# Deep Learning

Notebooks for the course "Deep Learning" given by Andy Louwyck during academic year 2023-2024 at the [Vives University of Applied Sciences](https://www.vives.be/en/vives-international) in Kortrijk, Belgium.

The course uses the excellent textbook ["Deep Learning with Python (2nd Ed.)"](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition) by [Fran√ßois Chollet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Chollet) (2021).

- Topics 1 to 14 correspond to chapters 1 to 14 from the book by Chollet. Missing topics are chapters without code examples or chapters that were not treated in class. See Toledo for an overview of the course material.
- Topic 15 is the [PyTorch tutorial for beginners](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html)
- Topic 16 is the online [course on diffusion models](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/diffusion-models) by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)
- Topic 17 is an introduction to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), to [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/), and to [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/). The second notebook is adopted from the online course on [building Generative AI Applications with Gradio](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/huggingface-gradio/) by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/). The third notebook is inspired by the first two [LangChain tutorials](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/).
- Topic 18 is based on chapters 3 to 5 from the text book ["Grokking Deep Learning"](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning) by Andrew W. Trask (2019) and on the [lecture about artificial neural networks](https://youtu.be/-fU-1E-R-xA) taught by Wouter Deketelaere at the KdG University of Applied Sciences and Arts in Antwerp.
