- Topics 1 to 14 correspond to chapters 1 to 14 from the book by Chollet. Missing topics are chapters without code examples or chapters that were not treated in class. See Toledo for an overview of the course material.
- Topic 15 is the [PyTorch tutorial for beginners](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html)
- Topic 16 is the online [course on diffusion models](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/diffusion-models) by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)
